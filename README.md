# The-Wearable-Fall-Detection-of-Elderly-People
# Problem Statement

Elderly individuals are highly prone to accidental falls, which often lead to severe injuries or even fatalities if timely assistance is not available. Traditional monitoring methods rely on manual observation or stationary sensors, which fail to provide real-time alerts during emergencies. Therefore, there is a pressing need for a portable, reliable, and automatic fall detection system that can ensure immediate response and continuous health monitoring.

# Objective

To design and develop a wearable fall detection device that continuously monitors the user’s motion and health parameters using integrated sensors. The system aims to detect falls accurately and send real-time alerts through IoT connectivity to caregivers or emergency services, enhancing safety and response time for elderly individuals.

# Novelty

The proposed device combines multi-sensor integration (MPU-3050, FSR-402, SpO₂) with IoT and Embedded C programming in a lightweight, compact wearable design. Unlike conventional single-sensor systems, this model improves accuracy (>90%), ensures real-time alert transmission (<1 second delay), and maintains comfort and portability, making it ideal for continuous use by the elderly.
